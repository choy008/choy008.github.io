      And so I landed on [Astro](https://astro.build/), which was modern, scalable and rapidly growing. All that was needed was a project rewrite from Ruby to JSX, which only took about a week. The rewrite PR can be found [here](https://github.com/swift502/Web/pull/8).
      After the rewrite, the website looks almost identical, but everything under the hood has changed and allowed for various performance optimizations and visual improvements. Feel free to check out this site's repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/swift502/Web)!
